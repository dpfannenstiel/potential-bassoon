A multipart file downloader.

You may build the application in release mode by navigating to the project path `potential-bassoon`
and then using `xcodebuild` from the command line.
This will build the application at $(SRCROOT)/buiid/Release/potential-bassoon.
Note that you man have to set your team in the Xcode project.
Building the application against the Debug configuration will allow additional
build flags to be invoked.
